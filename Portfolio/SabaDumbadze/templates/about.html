            <p class="a2-title2">
                My fascination with the digital world began with a simple question: "How does it work?" That curiosity led me to the world of programming, where I discovered that code is more than just logic—it is a tool for creation. As a teen developer, I bring a fresh, modern perspective to every project, blending the energy of youth with the discipline of professional software engineering.

            <p class="a2-title2">
                I don’t just build websites; I build experiences. Whether I am architecting a complex backend with Django or perfecting a responsive layout with CSS, my goal remains the same: to create digital environments that are intuitive, accessible, and high-performing. I believe that great software should feel invisible to the user—it should just work, seamlessly and beautifully.

                <h3>Technical Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    I specialize in the Python/Django ecosystem, which allows me to build secure and scalable applications. On the frontend, I focus on "Clean UI" principles—ensuring that every pixel has a purpose. From managing PostgreSQL databases to deploying live applications, I handle the full lifecycle of a project with precision and a focus on long-term maintainability.

            <div class="info-card">
                <h3>Collaborative Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    Every great project starts with a conversation. I value clear communication and transparency, working closely with clients or teams to translate abstract ideas into functional reality. I use tools like Figma for design prototyping and Git for version control, ensuring a workflow that is organized, professional, and ready for growth.

        <h2 class="mission-title">Beyond the Code</h2>
        <p>
            When I’m not writing code, I’m usually exploring the latest trends in UI/UX design or diving into new backend technologies to stay ahead of the curve. I am driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and the satisfaction of seeing a project go live. My mission is to help brands, NGOs, and businesses establish a digital presence that truly reflects their values and vision.
